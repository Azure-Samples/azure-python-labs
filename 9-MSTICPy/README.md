# Cyber Security Investigations and Analysis with MSTICPy

This lab provides you with an interactive introduction to [MSTICPy](https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy).<br>
MSTICPy is an open source cyber security tool kit created by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center to support security analysts during investigations and threat hunting.If you want to know more about MSTICPy before starting this lab take a look at [our documentation over at ReadTheDocs](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)<br>

## What we will cover in the lab
In this lab you will learn about and use the main features of MSTICPy. The lab is split into several sections, each one focused on a key element of MSTICPy:
- Data Acquisition
- Data Enrichment
- Extracting Key Data
- Data Visualization
- Pivots in MSTICPy
- ML in MSTICPy

In each section you will have a set of guided examples that show you how the features work and how to call them. After the examples are short lab exercises for you to complete, these involve using the features you have just seen examples of. 
Don't worry if you can't complete any of the lab exercises, they are not required to move onto the next section. You can also view a completed version of the notebook [here](https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy-lab/blob/main/MSTICPy_Lab_Completed.ipynb).

## How to use the lab
If you wish you can download the complete lab from [this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy-lab) and run the notebook locally. However, a much easier experience is to click the 'Launch Binder' button below to launch the lab using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). This will load the notebook in a pre-configured environment that you can access straight from the browser without any setup required. The notebook contains all instructions and resources required for the lab.
