# Azure Python Labs

A collection of labs demonstrating how to build Python applications with Azure and Visual Studio Code.

Join the Microsoft Python Discord (http://aka.ms/python-discord ) and the **#python-virtual-labs** channel to ask questions, get help with labs, and/or further instructions (also see: <https://aka.ms/python-virtual-labs> for our PyCon Online 2021 experience).


## Sentiment Analysis with Python Azure Functions

In this lab, you will build a serverless HTTP API with Azure Functions that takes a sentence as an input and returns the sentiment of the sentence.

- Build a serverless HTTP API with Azure Functions
- Run and debug the API locally on your machine
- Deploy the API to Azure Functions

[Sentiment Analysis with Python Azure Functions lab](4-azure-functions-python-vscode/README.md) | Duration: 7 minutes

## Document recognition with Python Azure Form Recognizer

In this lab, you will learn how to quickly store information you collect from your documents and receipts and prepare them for further analysis. You will learn to:

- Deploy new resources in Azure
- Write your own code using new Python packages for Azure
- Analyze the information returned from the service

## Cyber Security Investigations and Analysis with MSTICPy

This lab is an introduction to MSTICPy - an open source cyber security tool kit created by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center. In this lab you will learn about the core features of MSTICPy, and how to use to them in cyber security incident response or threat hunting. This lab takes the form of a Jupyter Notebook that you can run locally or directly in your browser.

## Explore Azure Database for PostgreSQL with Python

In this lab, you will learn how to import data into an Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance using a python script and the `psycopg2` module. You will learn to:

- Connect to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- Use the `psycopg2` to load and query data in the database.

## Explore the Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) with Python

- Get hands-on with Dapr by running it on your local machine through the [Try Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/) experience.
- Explore State Mangement and Secrets building blocks via the REST API using cURL (optional), Python Requests, and the Dapr SDK for Python ([dapr/python-sdk](https://github.com/dapr/python-sdk)).
- Seamlessly swap the State component from local development to a managed service in the cloud.

## Real-Time Analytics on Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)

This workshop is meant to be an introduction to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale (Citus). First, you will create a cluster to scale out PostgreSQL and turn it into a distributed database. Then, you will create a schema and tables, load test data, and create a rollup function to massively speed up your query workload.

## Training Digit Recognition Model with Azure Machine Learning

In this lab, you will learn how to train and track a machine learning model on a cloud compute cluster through Azure Machine Learning. You will learn to:

- Deploy machine learning resources in Azure.
- Submit a training job to Azure Machine Learning.
- Use the Azure Machine Learning extension to monitor the state of your run.
- Add logging metrics to your training job.
- Resubmit and track your metrics in the Azure Machine Learning studio.
